## 1. Introduction

You have already seen how to pull the information off the incoming RESTfull request URI
and inject it into the Java method parameters using the `@PathParam` annotation from the JAX RS API.

@PathParam("id") int id -----------> /Patient/1

from the previous URI, it pulls 1 and injects it into `id`. The web services frameworks like Apache CXF
or Jersey automatically does it for us. 
The JAX RS API also provides several other annotations to pull and inject other types of 
HTTP data like Query parameters, the form parameters, the header parameters that come with the HTTP:
`@QueryParam`, `@FormParam`, `@HeaderParam`, `@CookieParam`


**

## 2. REST Injection UseCase and Project Creation:
We will create a very simple RESTful service called `Passenger Service`. Let's say we're looking for an Airplane reservation 
system where in this passenger service will:
* `getPassengers` allows us to get all the passengers list.
* `addPassenger` allows us to create a new passenger.

The goal is to learn how to pass query, header, form parameters and Cookies.

## 3. Create the Passenger Model and Service Classes:

** 

## 4. Implement the REST layer:

** 


## 5. Test the Passenger Service:

** 

## 6. Use` @QueryParam`

**

## 7. Use `@FormParam`:

** 

## 8. Use`@HeaderParam`:

## 9. Use `@Context`:

## 10. Read Cookies:
