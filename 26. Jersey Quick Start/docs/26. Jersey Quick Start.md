## 1. Introduction

Jersey is an Open source web services **Stack** from Oracle. It is the official reference implementation of 
the JAX-RS API. Very similar to Apache CXF, on the server side, Jersey provides a servlet implementation which
scans through the predefined classes which we define to identify the RESTful resources.
* In `web.xml` (which is the deployment descriptor file for the web application), we configure:
  * this RESTful.
  * servlet (or we configure this Jersey servlet).  

Jersey also provides implementation of the client library which is 100 percent compliant with the JAX RS Client API.

In addition to the standard support (Just like Apache CXF), It also provides several custom tools for security like
OAuth, WSDL generation, Bean validation etc.

The current version of Jersey is `2.35`
