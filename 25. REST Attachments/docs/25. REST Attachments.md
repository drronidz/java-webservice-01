## 1. Introduction


  We will understand how to exchange files or attachments in RESTful web services world. The use case could be you
  uploading your resume from the web browser to a job portal which exposes out RESTful services, or you use a client
  application to consume attachments from a RESTful web application. All this is possible to upload and download files
  using the HTTP standard and it has been a part of HTTP standard for quit some time.
  
  We can use the HTTP POST method to upload a file as a part of the HTTP POST stream, that entire file contents will be
  sent to that application. The application will then read the contents of the post stream, and it will save them to file
  on its file system.
  
  Similarly, we can download files on to a web browser, or a RESTful web application using the GET method.

Since it's a part of the HTTP standard, it's out there n the HTML world and it was being
used for quite some time.

* The main piece here is the form:
  * `action` points to a **URI** on the server. It could be an absolute **URL** as well
  as the server location and everything.
  * `method` the method we use is POST.
  * `enctype` encoding type (the important attribute). We are telling the web browser 
  that we should use:
    * `multipart/form-data` that means whatever fields are there in here inside the form,
    the file field, the submit button, They should be split into multiple parts and sent
    to the server. So, we use the input type `file` to browse to a file location on our 
    machine.

* In the case of **Apache CXF**, the incoming file is automatically parsed and converted into an object called **Attachment**.
From these attachments, we can get the input stream and simply save that input stream onto our file system.

* **`Attachment`** class is from the **Apache CXF**, is not from the **JAX-RS API**.
* **Jersey** have its own implementation for the **`Attachment`** class, or it can call it something else.
* Similarly, other REST frameworks can implement their own objects to parse out the multipart and make this data available
as a stream of its own.


* To download files, 
   * We can simply create an instance of **`java.util.File`** object.
   * Point it to a file on our machine.
   * Send it back as a part of our RESTful response.
