## 1. Usecase and Steps:

We will create the WSDL from scratch.
The customer orders use case is where we have:

WSDL **Type** section:

* `CreateOrders` allows the web service consumer to 
  * send in a `CreateOrdersRequest` which will have : 
    * `customerId`.
    * List of orders.
    
  * A response via `CreateOrdersRequest` will be a simple boolean.
    * `True` the creation process is successful.
    * `False` the creation process is fail (there is a problem).
    
* `GetOrders` 
  * `GetOrdersRequest` by giving a 
    * `customerId` in the request:
    
  * `GetOrdersReponse` by getting a :
    * List of orders.
* `<types>`:  
* `<messages>` :
* `<porttype>` :
* `<binding>` :
* `<service>` :
