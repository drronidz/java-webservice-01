## 1. Introduction:
There are various Java libraries that can be used to create a Java web services REST client or consumer. This is because
REST uses HTTP methods. We can simply use  `java.net.URL` class which supports all HTTP methods.
We can open a connection and create an output stream and then deal with all the low level details of the API or simply use the 
Apache's HTTP Client which is far easier the URL class to use or simply use the JAX RS Client API. We as developers will learn one single
API which is standard from Oracle and implementors or web services stack creators like Apache CXF or Jersey will implement this API
making our job easier.So today we use Apache CXF, your application but if tomorrow your application needs to use another web services stack we
can simply switch it because we still have the API which is standard in our application.
