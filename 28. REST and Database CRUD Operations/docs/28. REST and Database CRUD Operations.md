## 1. Usecase and Steps:

We will perform **CRUD** operations against database table using  a RESTful API.
the objective is to expose out a RESTful API that will allow the end clients 
to perform CRUD operations against a real database.

* Create a DATABASE table.
* Spring DATA JPA (Behind the scenes it will use Hibernate to perform ORM object relational mapping).
* We are going to deal with a object or entity called product that matches the database.
* Creating a `productRepository` interface that will extend another interface from spring.
* Creating the web services class and using the JAX RS annotation on them and this implementation (`ProductService` and
`ProductServiceImpl`).
