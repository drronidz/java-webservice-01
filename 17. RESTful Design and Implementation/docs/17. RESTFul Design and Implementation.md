## 1. Introduction
We are going to start this section by 

   * learning the four simple steps that are required to design a RESTful.
   * moving on to the implementation of RESTful services by learning what JAX-RS is and the important annotations in the JAX-RS API.
   * implementing a Patient Management RESTful web service which supports both XML and JSON requests and responses.
   * understanding how to test a RESTful web services using REST plugin this is available for Chrome web browser.
   * learning how to implement RESTful clients, web service clients for your applications both in Java and JavaScript in our web applications.

## 2. REST Design:
we will design a Patient Management application which allow us to ADD, READ, UPDATE and DELETE patient information and all of his prescriptions and medication
information. We will do this in the following four simple steps:
   1. Identify the resources: the objects needed to be exposed out as REST service. we will use the object model, or the class diagram for our application:
   
       ![plot](./images/1.png) 
   
         * Patient can have multiple prescriptions.
         * Prescription can have multiple medicines.
         * The PatientService contains the CRUD operations to manipulate the previous classes.
       
       this three classes considered as a Data Transfer Objects
   
   2. Create the URIs to access those resources: will allow us to easily access these resources.
        * Creating a Patient: pass the data to `/patients`.
        * Reading a Patient: by passing the unique id to `/patients/{id}`.
        * Updating a Patient: pass the data to `/patients`.
        * Removing a Patient: pass the unique id to `/patients/{id}`.
   
   
   3. Assign the HTTP methods: to assign the HTTP methods to perform the four CRUD operations.
         * Creating a Patient: `POST`.
         * Reading a Patient: `GET`.
         * Updating a Patient: pass the data to `PUT`.
         
         **Note**: don't use `POST` (Because we don't want to change the state of the application).
         
         * Removing a Patient: pass the unique id to `DELETE`.
   
   
   3. Choose the data format: to come up with the request and response messages using that particular data format.
        * Read:
             
             * Request: /patients/123
             * Response
             
                 ````xml
                      <Patient>
                        <id>123</id>
                        <name>DIAB</name>
                      </Patient>
                 ````
                     
        * Create:
             * Request:
             
                  ```xml
                   <Patient>
                       <name>ABDOU</name>
                   </Patient>                       
               ```
             * Response:
                
                  ````xml
                       <Patient>
                        <id>124</id>
                        <name>DIAB</name>
                      </Patient>
                  ````
             **Note**: The id here is got generated on the server side.  
                        
        * Update:
             * Request:
                  ````xml
                       <Patient>
                           <id>124</id>
                           <name>ABDELHALIM</name>
                       </Patient>
                  ````     
             * Response: HTTP / 1.1 200 OK
                          
        * Delete:
             * Request: /patients/123
             * Response: HTTP / 1.1 200 OK
             
                          
        
   **Note**: We are going to choose `XML` for this use case (JSON for later).
