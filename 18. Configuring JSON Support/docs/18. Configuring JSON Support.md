## 1. 2 - Steps to configure JSON Support:


The main advantage of Restful web services is they support a different data types and not just XML (the main major over SOAP).
Apache CXF by default uses XML as the data format RESTful web services, and it has inbuilt support for it.
To turn on `JSON` support, we need to do three additional steps which are very simple :
1. Add `Jackson` Dependencies : `Jackson` is third party open source library which specializes in serializing Java objects into `JSON`
    * `jackson-jaxrs`
    * `jackson-xc`    
2. Change the configuration: we need to tweak the spring board properties file a little.
3. Use the `@Consumes` and `@Produces` annotations on our RESTful services to tell Apache CXF what all data types we want to support in our 
RESTful application.

## 6. REST Design and Implementation Summary:

There are 4 steps in designing and implementing RESTful services.
 * Identify the resources: by identifying all the nouns in our application, and those nouns become the RESTful resources.
 * Create the URIs: that can be used to access those resources to perform all the CRUD operations on those resources.
 * Assign HTTP methods : `POST` `GET` `DELETE` `PUT`
 * Choose the data formats: it could be JSON, XML, CSV etc.
