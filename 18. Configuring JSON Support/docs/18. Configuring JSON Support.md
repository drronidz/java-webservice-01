## 1. 2 - Steps to configure JSON Support:




The main advantage of Restful web services is they support a different data types and not just XML (the main major over SOAP).
Apache CXF by default uses XML as the data format RESTful web services, and it has inbuilt support for it.
To turn on `JSON` support, we need to do three additional steps which are very simple :
1. Add `Jackson` Dependencies : `Jackson` is third party open source library which specializes in serializing Java objects into `JSON`
    * `jackson-jaxrs`
    * `jackson-xc`    
2. Change the configuration: we need to tweak the spring board properties file a little.
3. Use the `@Consumes` and `@Produces` annotations on our RESTful services to tell Apache CXF what all data types we want to support in our 
RESTful application.
